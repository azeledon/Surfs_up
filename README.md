## Analysis

According to the results of our data analysis, the standard deviation in June was 3.25 and in December was 3.75, resulting in a difference of 0.5 between the two seasons. Furthermore, the current data contains attributes such as precipitation and others, which were the focus of our analysis. The weather data for June and December was analyzed to inform the decision-making process regarding the construction of the shop and the selection of locations that would appeal to visitors and ensure the success of the business.
